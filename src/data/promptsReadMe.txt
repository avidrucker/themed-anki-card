Prompts seem like tricky business, however they are actually simple.
	
	Prompts exist to test one capability at a time, using one method.
	For example, one could test your ability to understand the word "arigatou"
	in Japanese via audio (your ability to hear to hear it is key here).
	Therefore, there are two knowledge "vectors" being engaged at any time.
	Vectors include reading, writing, speaking & listening, but could also
	include visual comprehension, cultural comprehension, or another foundational
	skill such as alphabets or awareness of (not just the ability to hear) tonal
	information/encoding, etc..

	As these learning modules are meant to be used individually, the prompts
	need to be clear, concrete, to the point, and not be open to subjectivity.
	The ability of the learner to answer prompts should clearly fall into either
	success or failure (no partials!). For example, either the learner reads
	"arigatou" and says "thank you" or "thanks" (this term has two acceptable
	translations), or they don't.

	KEY:
	
	AUDITORY
	1A. hearSpeak = repeat (SHALLOW, MAY BE USEFUL FOR BEGINNERS)
	1B. hearKnow = listening comprehension (RECOMMENDED)
	1C. hearDistinguish = dubbed "sound karuta" by AD, this is for telling two similar sounding
			words apart, such as a "A-me" rain and "a-ME" candy (which vary only in intonation).

	VISUAL
	2A. lookSpeak = visual identification (RECOMMENDED)
	
	TRANSLATION
	3A. recall = l1 to l2 translation (RECOMMENDED)

	READING
	4A. readKnow = reading comprehnsion (HELPFUL, BUT NOT SUPER EFFECTIVE)
	4B. readSpeak = reading comprehension + speaking practice (BETTER THAN ABOVE)
	4C. readPhonetic = pronunciation practice & phonetic character recognition (THIS IS A STEP 0 ITEM, SKIPPABLE AT A COST)
	
	WRITING
	5A. copyWrite = writing skills & attention to detail
			(SQUARE 0: BEST NOT TO SKIP, BUT DON'T STAY HERE FOR LONG)
	5B. convertWriteTranslit = converting from transliteration in l1 to l2 transliteration
			(ie. romanji to kana) (RECOMMENDED COMPROMISE BETWEEN 5A & 5C)
	5C. hearWrite = dictation, combining listening & writing (ADVANCED LEARNERS ONLY)
